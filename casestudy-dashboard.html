                <strong class="green large" id="p-title">Who is Netpulse?</strong>
                <p>
                    Netpulse is the #1 mobile SaaS company in the <span class="red">fitness industry</span>, providing <span class="red">white labeled apps</span> to hundreds of brands around the world. From 24 Hour Fitness to your neighborhood's mom-and-pop facility, Netpulse creates effective B2B2C solutions to make the sometimes scary world of fitness a little more approachable for meatheads and newbies alike.
                </p>
                <strong class="green large" id="p-title">The Mobile Product</strong>
                <p>
                    The Netpulse mobile platform is white-labeled for 600+ gyms. While large enterprises such as 24 Hour Fitness, Equinox, and Planet Fitness have more customized apps, the majority of clients use our base platform that was acquired from Club Apps in 2014. <span class="red">The launching point for this app is the dashboard</span>, it’s the hub of the experience for the end user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And while the dashboard plays such an important role in the app, it had not been rethought in years and was <span class="red">falling behind</span> as the rest of the platform grew around it.

                    <li>Surface more of the club’s branding</li>
                    <li>Provide a more personalized experience for the user</li>

                <strong class="green large" id="p-title">Scaling Back</strong>
                <p>
                    In collaboration with the other Product Designer, we decided to move forward to testing a design with tabbed dashboard & personalized side menu based on ability to solve our three goals in 2-3 sprints.
                </p>
                    The design included:
                <ul>
                    <li>Tab bar navigation and full-width feature tiles </li>
                    <li class="indent">Provides hierarchy based on type of feature (personal fitness life vs.      facility based events) </li>
                    <li>Smaller opaque tiles allow for club’s brand to shine through </li>
                    <li>Profile photo + updated side menu provide a more personalized experience  to the user</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

            <div class="body-copy">
                <strong class="green large" id="p-title">User Testing Structure</strong>
                <p>
                    I created 6 <span class="red">fully-functional, custom-branded prototypes</span>, for 6 of our clients using Invision. We chose a variety of health clubs to test with (from enterprise to SMB) and mapped their existing features to the new two-part dashboard so they would get as realistic of an experience as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I ran task based user testing with Club Managers to test the usability of the new navigation as well as get their feedback on their club’s updated branding.
                </p>
                <strong class="green large" id="p-title">User Testing Results</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Overall <span class="green">positive</span> feedback to UI changes, especially the inclusion of an avatar/profile photo</li>
                    <li>Overall <span class="red">negative</span> feedback to the tab bar navigation</li>
                    <li class="indent">Club Managers felt that features within the “My Gym” section would  never be used</li>
                    <li class="indent">They were very unhappy with the fact that any kind of promotional tile  would wind up on the "second" dashboard</li>
                    <li class="indent">They were especially unhappy with Rewards or Referrals based  features not appearing on the "main" dashboard</li>
                </ul>
                <strong class="green large" id="p-title">Launching Dashboard 2.0</strong>
                <p>
                    In concurrence with testing the new dashboard UX, our engineers had been working on making the back end of the dashboard and feature set up much more stable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of this engineering effort, we launched the updated dashboard design (without the tabbed navigation) with new clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the meantime, I continued iterating and testing the UX to find a solution that would solve the user facing issues we were originally trying to solve.

                <strong class="green large" id="p-title">Further Design Iteration</strong>
                <p>
                    Through running tests with Club Managers, I uncovered a new, larger problem that needed to be solved:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="red">How do I create a more personalized experience for the end user (Club Goers) while balancing the priorities of our clients (Club Managers)?</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through this question came the concept of an additional dynamic dashboard.
                </p>
                <strong class="green large" id="p-title">Dashboard 2.1</strong>
                    The final solution (below) features several key changes: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        All navigation is brought into the footer for easier access, including a “quick  action button” featuring the most used/most important user actions 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The “Dashboard” tab stays exactly the same as the dashboard Club  Managers approved in round 1 of testing. (Their tiles, their order, no funny  business.) 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A “Most Used” tab is introduced to begin giving a personalized experience to  the user
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <strong class="green large" id="p-title">Testing (Again)</strong>
                <p>
                    I held another round of user testing with the same 6 health clubs and received almost exclusively positive feedback on version 2.1.
                </p>
                <strong class="green large" id="p-title">Conclusion</strong>
                <p>
                    After the redesign is implemented, we will be tracking analytics to further test our hypotheses on users. 
                </p>
                    Some indicators we will be looking out for include:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Are sessions increasing in length?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Is there less of a drop off after check-in?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Are more users directly recording workouts or booking classes?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Is there more movement between features?
                    </li>
                </ul>
