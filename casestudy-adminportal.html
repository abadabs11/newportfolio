                    <p>
                        As a <span class="red">Lead Product Designer</span> I worked directly with our PMs, engineers, clients, and end users. Because the product team averaged around 5 – 6 team members, I had the opportunity to take the lead on every aspect of multiple projects from discovery to implementation. These projects included both mobile and web solutions.

                        I also created and documented the (previously non-existent) product design process with our other internal PD. Here are a few of the major initiatives we implemented:

                    I began by keeping the existing card design but updating them to accommodate the new, more detailed Class feedback. Hierarchy was brought into the ticket sorting, surfacing the negative tickets at the top so the Club Manager can quickly put out any fires.

                        Tickets were moved into two columns for faster scanning. Negative tickets and positive tickets with testimonials were given more weight so user can focus on resolving highest priority tasks. Issues: side by side tickets required too much cognitive load from users.

                <p>
                    The existing hierarchy of information was not great at providing the user with the right amount of information at the right time. I explored surfacing higher level reporting for chain admin who are interested in how their locations are doing but aren't dealing with individual tickets. I also explored various ways to sort the tickets themselves to empower the admin to deal with the most pressing issues quickly and without losing track of any feedback.

                    The auto post 'web widget' is a new feature we created for the 2.0 MVP launch. While Feedback 1.0 helped club admin appease members before they churned, it didn't provide an adequate way to use testimonials to acquire new members. The web widget takes recent testimonials and outputs them into a lean JavaScript widget that can quickly and easily be added to any website. Timely feedback from actual members is far more powerful than the typical static testimonial section on marketing websites.

                    <div class="caption">The web widget will work with as much or as little effort the admin wants to put in. If they choose the auto post option all they have to do is set the refresh frequency and up to date testimonials will appear on their website.
